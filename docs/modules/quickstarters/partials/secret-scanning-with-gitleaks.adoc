== Secret scanning with gitleaks

This repository has a pre-commit hook that runs gitleaks on every commit.
To https://pre-commit.com/#install[install the hook], run:

After this every commit will inform you about any secrets that are committed.

If you want to skip this check, use the `--no-verify` flag when committing.
