= Plain docker image (docker-plain)

== Purpose of this quickstarter

Use this quickstarter when you want to start from a plain Dockerfile only, without any framework on top.
A good usecase here is a Dockerfile you found on GitHub which you want to run with OpenDevStack features,
or that you need to "OpenShiftify", by setting an (non-root) execution user, etc.

== What files / architecture is generated?

----
├── Jenkinsfile - Contains Jenkins build configuration
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── README.md
├── docker - Contains Dockerfile for the build
│   └── Dockerfile
├── metadata.yml - Component metadata
├── release-manager.yml - Configuration file for the Release Manager
└── sonar-project.properties  - SonarQube Configuration
----

== Frameworks used

None, except for the ODS https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library[jenkins shared library].

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

Amend the generated `Dockerfile` as needed.

=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
name: software-name
description: "Some software packaged in a docker container"
supplier: https://example.com
version: 3.2
type: ods-service
role: <the role of this software in the project>
```


== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

Whatever is in the `/docker` folder will be passed to `oc start build` as the docker context. You can add other files to that context as needed:

----
def stageBuild(def context) {
  stage('Build') {
    // copy any other artifacts, if needed
    // sh "cp -r build docker/dist"
    // the docker context passed in /docker
  }
}
----

In case you want to run unit tests, you can add a corresponding statement to `stageUnitTest`:

----
def stageUnitTest(def context) {
  stage('Unit Test') {
    // add your unit tests here, if needed
  }
}
----

Assuming your component contains source code you want to have delivered by the _Release Manager_, the execution of tests and the reporting of their results is mandatory. For this, your component will have to...

- define `name`, `description`, `supplier`, and `version` metadata for your component in `files/release-manager.yml`

- place the test results in the xUnit XML format in a path known to `context.testResults` (defaults to `build/test-results/test`)

- provide these test results to the link:https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit[Jenkins JUnit plugin] via its `junit` step function.
