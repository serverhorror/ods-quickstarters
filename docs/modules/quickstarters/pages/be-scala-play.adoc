= Backend Scala Playframework Quickstarter (be-scala-play)

== Purpose of this quickstarter

This is a https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.8.x[Play Framework 2.8.0] quickstarter with basic setup for https://www.docker.com/[Docker], https://jenkins.io/[Jenkins], https://www.sonarqube.org/[SonarQube] and https://www.openshift.com/[OpenShift].

Use it if you want to build an reactive Web Application / REST API based on the Scala Language.

== What files / architecture is generated?

An example Play Web Application is generated with a Controller and some tests.

== Frameworks used

This project is generated by https://www.scala-sbt.org/[SBT] using SBTs template generation via the `new` command.
The template used is an adapted version of the official https://github.com/playframework/play-scala-seed.g8[Play Scala Seed Template].

It will generate a Play Scala project using version 2.8.0 of Play with Scala version 2.13.1.
It uses the https://github.com/logstash/logstash-logback-encoder[logstash-logback-encoder] to output logmessages in logstash format.
It uses https://scalameta.org/scalafmt[Scalafmt] to check/format the source files consistently.

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

* Start the SBT shell with `sbt` in the project root directory.
* In the SBT shell run `test` for testing
* Or `run` for running locally in development mode with continous compiling. The application will be accessible under http://localhost:8080[http://localhost:8080]

== How this quickstarter is built through jenkins

The Jenkinsfile is provisioned with this quickstarter to ease CI/CD process.
In Jenkinsfile, there are various stages

* stageBuild - checks source files formatting, runs the tests and builds and copies the artifacts for creating the docker image to the `docker` directory.
