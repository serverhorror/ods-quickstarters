== Frameworks used

* https://docs.python.org/3.11[Python 3.11]
* https://docs.streamlit.io/library/changelog[streamlit]
* https://pandas.pydata.org/[pandas]
* https://plotly.com/python/[plotly]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The quickstarter sets up in OpenShift a pod with two containers. The main `ds-streamlit` container is  behind and protected by the https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy/[OpenShift OAuth proxy] container (i.e.: it is a sidecar container).

It is strongly recommended when you are developing a Python project to use separated environments.
For this purpose usually one can use Python's
https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/venv.html[venv] core package (check how to use it in the next steps).

NOTE: since the version of Python is 3.11, ensure your system's python executable is also in version 3.11

[source,bash]
----
# Create virtual environment 'mylocaldevelopment' (will be located in the folder mylocaldevelopment) (run only once)
python -m venv mylocaldevelopment

# Initiate virtual environment for the project (every time)
source mylocaldevelopment/bin/activate

# Runs installation of required modules in the virtual environment (run only once)
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Start your application
PYTHONPATH=src python src/main.py

```

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

The Jenkinsfile is provisioned with this quick starter to ease CI/CD process. In Jenkinsfile, there are various stages:

* *Prepare Test Suite* - Prepares the virtual environment for testing and linting:

* *Lint* - Runs mypy and flake8 for increasing code quality:
In order to be sure that your code passes the linting stage execute or add it as a pre-commit hook to your git.

[source,bash]

  black src
----

* *Test* - Runs pytest and generates xUnit and code coverage reports:

* *Build* - Builds the application: copies src folder into docker_streamlit/dist folder.
