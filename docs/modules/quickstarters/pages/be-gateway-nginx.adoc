= Backend - nginx  (be-gateway-nginx)

== Purpose of this quickstarter

Use this quickstarter when you want to use https://www.nginx.org[nginx] server wrapped within https://www.openresty.org[OpenResty] dynamic web platform. With this quickstarter you can run many different lightweight server implementations like API gateways and HTTP/TCP/UDP reverse proxies.

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

Simply start to configure your nginx.conf to fit your needs. Also, you can develop and/or use different Lua modules.


=== Routing to your services

In order to route/proxy to services in the same namespace you do not need to define environment variables for their ports and/or hosts.

OpenShift already loads them into the container's environment by following a convention like `<DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG>_SERVICE_HOST` and `<DEPLOYMENT_CONFIG>_SERVICE_PORT`. Please, follow the example provided and comments in the `nginx.conf` file.


=== Adding offical Lua modules

One can add official Lua modules by using https://opm.openresty.org/[opm].

In the following code snipped one can see how to add an official Lua module through docker build stage. Inside your Dockerfile:

```docker
RUN opm install zmartzone/lua-resty-openidc
```

Then, one can load such module dependency in new modules like:

```lua
local http = require("resty.openidc")
```

NOTE: `lua-resty-openidc` module is already provided with the default `Dockerfile`.

=== Using Lua modules

Lua integration in nginx requires following the https://openresty-reference.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Directives/[Directives] provided in its architecture. Notice the importance of the execution order of the directives.
Most of the directives require being defined inside your server *locations*. See next some possibilities one can make use of


`1` - Managing access with *access_by_lua_block*

With this directive one can integrate with Identity Providers via different auth/z standars, such as simple HTTP Basic Auth, OAuth, OIDC:

```lua
access_by_lua_block {
    require("your-auth-module").authenticate()
}
```

`2` - Managing content with *content_by_lua_block*

This directive handles content definition. See the provided *server-error.lua* module example; by loading the right *ENV* variables in *nginx.conf*, you can add in your error *location* block a custom server error handling:

```lua
location = /50x.html {
    content_by_lua_block {
        require("server-error").make_error()
    }
}
```

`3` - Handle incoming requests with *rewrite_by_lua_block*

One can also make use of the rewrite directive, for example, for filtering/rewriting incoming requests coming from your clients:

```lua
rewrite_by_lua_block {
    require("filter-requests-headers").run_filter()
}
```

`4` - Handle body responses with *body_filter_by_lua_block*

Filter the body responses comming from your Backend services. For example, one could filter any error response, so to assure filtering stack traces from a JSON object response when running on production:

```lua
body_filter_by_lua_block {
    require("filter-error-response").filter_stack_traces()
}
```

=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
