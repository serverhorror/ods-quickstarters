= Backend - Go (be-golang)

== Purpose of this quickstarter

Use this quickstarter when you want to use https://golang.org[Go]. Go is well
suited for CLI tools, network/operational related things and microservices.

== What files / which architecture is generated?

----
├── Jenkinsfile - Contains Jenkins build configuration
├── .pre-commit-config.yaml
├── README.md
├── docker - Contains Dockerfile for the build
│   └── Dockerfile
├── metadata.yml - Component metadata
├── release-manager.yml - Configuration file for the Release Manager
├── sonar-project.properties - SonarQube Configuration
├── main.go - Example Go file
----

== Frameworks used

None, except the ODS https://github.com/opendevstack/ods-jenkins-shared-library[Jenkins Shared Library]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

Simply start to write Go code, e.g. by extending `main.go`. No further adjustments
should be necessary. Typically, you'd want to use Go modules:

----
go mod init example.com/project/component

=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
name: <the component id (this is the default, if omitted)>
description: "Some microservice implemented in golang"
supplier: https://example.com
version: 1.0.1
type: ods
role: backend
```

== How this quickstarter is built through Jenkins

There are six steps:

* Check that all files are gofmt'd.
* Run SonarQube analysis.
* Run all package tests.
* Build the binary (placing it into the `docker` directory).
* Build the container image.
* Deploy.
