* https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/[JupyterLab]

== Usage - how do you start after you provisioned this quickstarter

The quickstarter sets up two pods in OpenShift. The `ds-jupyter-lab` instance is routed through the https://github.com/openshift/oauth-proxy/[OpenShift OAuth proxy] instance.

The directory `/opt/app-root/src/work` is created where code can be organized using installed git. +
Please consider mounting a persistent volume claim for this path. +
New python requirements are specified using the `requirements.txt`. +

=== Setting up independent environments/kernels ===

One can setup specific and independent IPython kernels based on specific Python virtual environments:

* Open a new terminal session in your Jupyter Lab, then:

----
cd <PATH_WHERE_TO_LOCATE_NEW_VENV_OR_NONE>
python -m venv <YOUR NEW VENV NAME>
. <YOUR NEW VENV NAME>/bin/activate
pip install ipykernel pip --upgrade
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<YOUR NEW VENV NAME>
jupyter kernelspec list  # this is for validating installation
----

Now on a notebook you can select that new kernel by clicking on the name you see on the top right where you see the dot status.

=== Metadata

The following are typical xref:quickstarters:metadata.adoc[metadata] values that can be used for components based on this quickstarter:
Note that the xref:jenkins-shared-library:labelling.adoc[OpenShift resources will be labeled] based on this metadata.

```yaml
name: jupyterlab
description: "JupyterLab is a web-based interactive development environment for Jupyter notebooks, code, and data."
supplier: https://jupyter.org/
version: 3.0.14
type: ods-service
```

== How this quickstarter is built through jenkins

The build pipeline is defined in the `Jenkinsfile` in the project root. The main stages of the pipeline are:

. Start OpenShift build
. Deploy image to OpenShift

== Builder agent used

== Known limitations

Consider if sufficient computing resources can be provided by the OpenShift cluster. +
You might require installing NodeJS if requiring specific JupyterLab extensions (nodejs >=12.0.0).
